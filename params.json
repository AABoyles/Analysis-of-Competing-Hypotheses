{"name":"Analysis of Competing Hypotheses","body":"Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) is a simple model for how to think about a complex problem. It is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that is consistent and inconsistent with each hypothesis, and rejects hypotheses that contain too much inconsistent data. It was created in the 1970s at the CIA.\r\n\r\nThis software is an open source platform for conducting the methodology with several people. \r\n\r\nFor information about installation, usage, contributions, etc., see the project site at http://competinghypotheses.org.\r\n\r\nAuthors:<br />\r\n  *  Copyright [Matthew Burton](http://matthewburton.org) 2010<br />\r\n  *  Code by [Joshua Knowles](http://auscillate.com)<br />\r\n  *  Fork by [Tony Boyles](http://nortalktoowise.com)\r\n","tagline":"Analyze more Objectively and Collaboratively","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
